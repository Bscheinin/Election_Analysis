# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview
A Colorado Election employee requested that the following audit tasks be completed for a local congressional election:

1. Determine the total number of votes cast in the local election.
2. Create a list of the candidates who received votes.
3. Calculate the total votes for each candidate.
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate received.
5. Determine the winner of the election based on the highest percentage of the popular vote.

## Project Resources

Souce data: election_results.csv

Programs used: Python 3.7 and Visual Studio Code v1.63.2 

## Audit Summary
The results of the audit of this local congressional elections showed a total of **369,711** votes cast. 

The candidates who received votes were:
- Charles Casper Stockham
- Diana DeGette
- Raymon Anthony Doane

The vote percentage and vote totals were:

- Charles Casper Stockham received 23.0% of the total votes with 85,213 votes.
- Diana DeGette received 73.8% of the total votes with 272,892 votes.
- Raymon Anthony Doane received 3.1% of the total votes with 11,606 votes.

The audit showed the winner of the local congressional election to be **Diana DeGette** with **73.8%** of the total votes by winning a total of **272,892** votes.

# Challenge Overview and Summary
This challenge was the first to employ the use of Python programming. Python is an open-source computer programming language that is easy to understand because it uses the same syntax as English. This makes it easy to learn as well. Once the basic structure of the programming language is understood (data structure, decision statements, etc.) analyzing data with Python is fairly straightforward.

Data analytics on the local congressional election audit started with importing and inspecting the raw data. The process of pseudocoding allowed a map of the solution to be drawn which helped guide the coding for the project.

One of the unique advantages to Python are the built-in dependencies, packages and modules that allow faster programming by use of pre-written code for Python. Exploring these resources was overwhelming at first but exemplified the power of Python as a community coding language.
